# __Introduction__ 

---


While Laravel does not dictate which JavaScript or CSS pre-processors you use, it does provide a basic starting point using [Bootstrap](https://example.com), [React](https://example.com), and / or [Vue](https://example.com) that will be helpful for many applications. By default, Laravel uses NPM to install both of these frontend packages.
This legacy package is a very simple authentication scaffolding built on the Bootstrap CSS framework. While it continues to work with the latest version of Laravel, you should consider using Laravel Breeze for new projects.
Or, for something more robust, consider Laravel Jetstream
